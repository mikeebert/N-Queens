This is my work-in-progress shot at the solution to N Queens.

As of 4/17/12 it solves up to 20 queens but I'm still working on it. 

To-do's:
- Clean up ugly diagonal check methods
- Move away from explicit return of true
- Develop consistent "availability" check (currently column & row checks @positions, diagonals check @board)
- Finish test for coordinates_of_next_move (where the recursion and while loop happen)
- Keep refactoring and optimizing.
